*Naming Fact: Hypthoecs is taken from Roman & Civil law, & is the word used to describe the situation where a debtor provides collateral in the form of ownership to a creditor, but retains possession of the item. Eg. Using tools as collateral, but maintaining possession, so you may use the tools for work to pay of your debt*
